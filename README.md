<strong>NOTES</strong></br>
- be sure all libs are ready to use the terminal commands (requirement.txt)
- CSV located in assets/data.csv
- you need to sell the 1st one manually: a transaction fee is necessary to let CARGO sell NFTs from this smart contract. Then you can run the script for next ones.
- this script is only to add price and royalties, not to update existing data.

<strong>STEPS</strong></br>
01. Open the terminal and navigate to the /bot folder.
02. Type "python main.py" to run the program.
03. Import your MEtamask address 
04. Login to CARGO using metamask (don't close the first tab!)
05. Press 'y' or 'Y' in the terminal.
06. Bot will run automatically from there
07. Logs will be stored in assets/output/{timestamp}.csv file.
